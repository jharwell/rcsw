Utils
=====

A miscellaneous collection of functions and macros that I found useful at one
time or another, but that did not warrant their own module. Full documentation
is in utils. Includes:

- 8, 16, 32 bit additive and XOR checksums
- Common hashing functions
- Memory manipulation (e.g., read-modify-write with verify)
- Timespec comparison/addition/etc.
- Random other things :-P
