Modules Summary
===============

RCSW is built around the idea of modules to help organize the code, and to
provide logical segmentation between (un)complementary areas of
functionality. Full details of modules is in the documentation, which can be
built with ``make apidoc``. Only a brief summary is given here.

All modules come with a thorough test suite; test suites also serve as example
usages.
